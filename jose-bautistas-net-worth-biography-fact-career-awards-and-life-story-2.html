Jose Bautista, AKA “Joey Bats,” earned his net worth over a 15-year career in the MLB playing for the Toronto Blue Jays and also the Orioles, Devil Rays, Royals, Pirates, Braves, Mets, and Phillies.</p><h2 id=early-life><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span><strong>Early Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jose Antonio Bautista Santos was born on October 19, 1980, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, into a middle-class family who placed an importance on education. His mother was an accountant and financial planner, and his father ran poultry farms after earning a master’s degree in agricultural engineering. Jose started studying at the age of eight and attended a private high school, De La Salle High School, where he played baseball.</p><p>He worked out for various MLB clubs and turned down a $5,000 offer from the New York Yankees and a $42,000 offer from the Arizona Diamondbacks. He accepted the Cincinnati Reds’ offer of $300,000, but before the contract could become official, the team changed ownership and the deal was rescinded. He decided to attend Chipola College and played there for two years until being drafted.</p><h2 id=mlb-career><span class=ez-toc-section id=mlb-career></span><strong>MLB Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jose Bautista was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates at 599th overall in the 20th round of the 2000 MLB Draft. He signed on with the team for a $500,000 signing bonus. The third baseman played in the minor leagues and then was taken in the Rule 5 Draft by the Baltimore Orioles. Bautista made his major league debut for the Orioles in April of 2004. He was claimed by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and then purchased by the Kansas City Royals before being traded to the New York Mets and then the Pittsburgh Pirates. Bautista is the only player to be on five different MLB rosters in one season. He settled in Pittsburgh until 2008 before he was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays.</p><p>The Blue Jays needed a third baseman to replace injured Scott Rolen, but in 2010, Bautista began the campaign as the starting right fielder. This is where he would really hit his stride and make a name for himself as a professional baseball player. He became a six-time All-Star (2010-2015), three-time Silver Slugger Award winner (2010, 2011, 2014), two-time Hank Aaron Award winner (2010, 2011), and two-time MLB home run leader (2010, 2011). In his last year with the Blue Jays, Bautista’s batting average dipped to .203, and the team declined his 2018 option.</p><p>Jose Bautista played for the Atlanta Braves, New York Mets, and Philadelphia Phillies over the course of the 2018 season but didn’t catch on with any of them. And after taking off the 2019 campaign, he never returned to the MLB.</p><p>Baustista has represented the Dominican Republic national baseball team who won a bronze medal at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.</p><p>In May of 2020, Bautista was named a special advisor to the general manager for the Leones del Escogido in the Dominican Professional Baseball League.</p><h2 id=contracts-amp-career-earnings><span class=ez-toc-section id=contracts-career-earnings></span><strong>Contracts & Career Earnings</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jose Bautista signed a five-year, $65 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays in 2011. After declining their $17.2 million qualifying offer in November of 2016, he signed a one-year, $18 million deal with the team in January of 2017.</p><p>Over his 15-year MLB career, Bautista has earned more than $105 million in salary alone.</p><h2 id=personal-life><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life></span><strong>Personal Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jose Bautista married Neisha Croyle in November of 2017. The couple has two daughters together.</p><p>Bautista’s father is Spanish, and Jose’s younger brother, Luis, played college baseball at Florida International University before being drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 32nd round of the 2007 MLB Draft where he played in their minor league system through 2008.</p><p>In 2011, Jose Bautista set up a program to help aid athletes and give them the same opportunity he had to attend American universities. Since its inception, it has expanded from the Dominican Republic into Canada.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKfqLJursCuq6KrpJbAbrrErWSwp6KptW6uyKieq5mgncZussCcq2abkaeypr6Mmq6aqpSoeqK6w2ajop6VYsC1u9GyZGtn</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kevin-sierra-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-42005-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kevin Sierra Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a>
