His cause of death was said to be due to drowning; first responders were responding to a call for cardiac arrest.</p><p>It's stated that Matthew was found in the jacuzzi on his property, but as TMZ noted, the exact location was unknown. Details were limited upon the first report, but TMZ suggested there was no foul play involved and that there were no drugs found on site.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/matthew-perry-dated-julia-robert-during-friends-but-ended-it-in-fear-of-getting-his-heartbroken.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Matthew Perry Dated Julia Robert During Friends But Ended It In Fear Of Getting His Heartbroken</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>They dated during Friends, however, thinks took a turn between Matthew Perry and Julia Roberts.</span><p>It was not suspected that substances were involved in Matthew's passing, but of course, only time and any toxicology reports or autopsy results will confirm that report.

While older posts on Perry's Instagram had a few hundred comments each, his final post from October 23rd had racked up thousands of comments within an hour of the report that he had passed.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew's last Instagram post</a> featured a snapshot of him in a hot tub at nighttime, ostensibly at his Los Angeles-area home.
