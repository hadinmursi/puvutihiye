Still unmarried, Jays star likes his dating life under the wraps.</p><p>He is a professional American baseball player for the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball. Bichette has been one of the most skilled players in the league and his family has a history with the game.</p><p>Bichette is very professional as he speaks mostly about his performance and game stats in the interviews and hasn’t even revealed who his girlfriend is. Fans believe he might have been dating someone, but the MLB star has always denied the rumor about his love life and wants not to discuss his matters in the media.</p><p>Recently, he has been a center of attraction among baseball fans due to his exceptional performance in MLB. Bichette hit three home runs in a game against the Baltimore Orioles on September 5, 2022. Along the way, he and teammate Vladimir Guerrero Jr. created history by being the first teammate to have a 3-home run game in a single season while having fathers who play in Major League Baseball.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Is Toronto Blue Jays’ Shortstop, Bo Bichette Married?">Is Toronto Blue Jays’ Shortstop, Bo Bichette Married?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Bo Bichette’s Net Worth In 2022">Bo Bichette’s Net Worth In 2022</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Bo Bichette’s Parents And Family Life">Bo Bichette’s Parents And Family Life</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4" href=# title="Bo Bichette’s MLB Career">Bo Bichette’s MLB Career</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5" href=# title="Bo Bichette’s Life Before MLB Fame">Bo Bichette’s Life Before MLB Fame</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-toronto-blue-jays-shortstop-bo-bichette-married></span>Is Toronto Blue Jays’ Shortstop, Bo Bichette Married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bo Bichette is very private, so that he wouldn’t reveal his personal life in front of the media. He is still unmarried in 2022. He grew up in a strict Christian family upbringing.</p><p>The Blue star is now at the peak of his career. He is doing wonders on the pitch, hitting big home runs to win the match for his team. He is one of the MVPs of the team and has vastly impacted the squad’s performance after joining Toronto’s team in 2019.</p><p>He believes baseball is the love of his life and wants to fully commit to it to become one of the greatest players in the league. With his performance lately, we can see his dream becoming true in the upcoming future.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bo-bichettes-net-worth-in-2022></span>Bo Bichette’s Net Worth In 2022<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bo Bichette has an&nbsp;estimated&nbsp;net worth of about $1.5 million. His paycheck from Major League Baseball as a regular and professional baseball player accounts for most of his income. Bo Bichette’s net worth may rise with the Major League Baseball All-Star game if he successfully hits well and short-stopping.</p><p>Bo will probably improve at the game because he only thinks about improving his game which can be seen in his recent performances. His statistics this season include 24 home runs, 87 batted in, and a respectable .281 average, which indicate that things are improving for this athlete.</p><p>Bichette can produce a lot of bat speed and power and is a power hitter. He accomplishes this by uncoiling with the bat at the same angle as his shoulders, separating and delaying body rotation when the foot strikes the ground following a leg kick, and then revealing his rear plate name and number.</p><p>In place of the leg kick when facing a strikeout or pay-off pitch, he bows his left knee inward. This specific game technique has handed him lots of success in recent years. He is evolving as one of the talented players of the game and hopes to continue playing this way in the future.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bo-bichettes-parents-and-family-life></span>Bo Bichette’s Parents And Family Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bichette was born on March 5, 1998, in Orlando, Florida as the second child of Dante Bichette and Mariana. His family has a great relationship with baseball as his father was one of the reputed players in the MLB, and his brother, Dante Bichette Jr, also pursued his professional baseball career but is currently seeking a team as a free agent.</p><p>He is a perfect example of a mixed-ethnic as his family is composed of different ethnic people from around the world. His father is a native of Florida, USA, while his mother is originally from Brazil. Due to this fact, both Bo and his brother Dante Jr. have represented Brazil in the WBC.</p><p>The reason for him being a cross-cultural personality doesn’t stop here. His maternal grandfather is of Chinese descent. Despite being an American national, he represents Toronto Blue Jays, a Canadian team competing in MLB. This makes him one of the rare players in MLB to have a direct relationship with countries like the USA, China, Brazil and Canada.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bo-bichettes-mlb-career></span>Bo Bichette’s MLB Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Blue Jays chose Bichette’s contract on July 29, 2019, and he was called to the major league. He hit his first major league single off Kansas City Royals pitcher Brad Keller in his second major league appearance. On July 31, Bichette had three hits, the second of which was his first MLB home run, all against the Royals.</p><p>With a double against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 6, Bichette made MLB history by becoming the first player to have ten extra-base hits in his first nine games. Following another double on August 7, Bichette eclipsed Carlos Delgado’s previous Blue Jays franchise record and became just the third player in the live-ball era to record an image in eight straight games.</p><p>The following day, Bichette made his debut in Toronto and increased his doubles streak to nine games, breaking the previous MLB record. He also established a new MLB record with 13 extra-base hits in his first 11 games of the season. Since Ted Williams in 1939, he is also the only rookie with nine straight games with extra-base hits. He also established a franchise record with 20 hits and an 11-game hit streak with a 1.316 OPS. Bichette received his first career All-Star citation on July 4, 2021.</p><p>Bichette had 54 RBI, 15 home runs, and a slash line of.290/.340/.529 at the time of his nomination. In a contest against the Baltimore Orioles on September 5, 2022, Bichette hit three home runs. Along the way, he and teammate Vladimir Guerrero Jr. created history by being the first teammate to have a 3-home run game in a single season while having fathers who play in Major League Baseball.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bo-bichettes-life-before-mlb-fame></span>Bo Bichette’s Life Before MLB Fame<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bichette was born in Florida, like his brother and father. He was exposed to baseball as his father was a successful player in the league, and his brother also played baseball in MLB for a while. He spent most of his life in the state while growing up and started a mature career there.</p><p>However, Bichette never got a physical chance to go to school as he received his education at home. Despite not being educated in a school, he played baseball for Lakewood High School in St. Petersburg, Florida. He batted.569 as a senior, hit 13 home runs, and was awarded Florida’s Mr Baseball and the Gatorade/USA Today Florida Player of the Year. Bichette decided to enrol at Arizona State University and play collegiate baseball with the Sun Devils.</p><p>Before unavailing his talents in the MLB, he had already amazed baseball fans with his performance in the minor league. In the second round of the 2016 Major League Baseball draft, the Toronto Blue Jays picked Bichette 66th overall. He signed on June 17 for a $1.1 million bonus and said later that he turned down four offers during the draft to choose Toronto.</p><p>Following an injury to his belly, which was later identified as a ruptured appendix, Bichette was placed on the 7-day injured list after beginning the season with a.431 hitting average through 18 games with the Gulf Coast League Blue Jays. He smashed many records that year and was eventually awarded the 2017 Minor League Hitter of the Year award on October 5 that year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGjYq%2BwecGimqGdpKmybrnAq6minZRixKmt02arqGWbo7y4ecCbpq6sXZe5trGMo5iyq12owaK%2BjKCgq6SWp7amusNmmKecXZmutbXNoGSloZaafA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./is-tracy-chapman-gay-unveiling-the-truth-behind-american-singers-sexuality.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is Tracy Chapman Gay?
