However, even people who think that Jamie Lynn has done a lot of rotten things should know that she clearly has a very good side. After all, it turns out that Jamie Lynn once put her own life on the line to physically defend one of her friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-jamie-lynn-spears-risked-her-life-to-save-a-friend>Why Jamie Lynn Spears Risked Her Life To Save A Friend</h2><p>In 2021, an episode of The New York Times Presents titled Framing Britney Spears aired and it sparked a massive response. An extremely telling documentary that showed the way that Britney has been treated over the years, fans were outraged by what the singer put up with from her father and how the press talked about her. On top of that, it was extremely shocking to see footage of Britney being put in danger due to the paparazzi harassing her everywhere she went. Given the peril Britney Britney often has been in over the years, it makes perfect sense that when she goes out in public, she often is accompanied by massive bodyguards.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything That Happened Since 'Framing Britney Spears' Premiered</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for Britney Spears’ little sister Jamie Lynn Spears, it seems that she doesn’t have bodyguards who protect her wherever she goes. After all, as it turns out, there was a night in 2015 in which Jamie Lynn clearly could have used a bodyguard to protect her and everyone she was with at the time. Fortunately for one of her friends, in the absence of a professional person being there to protect them, Jamie Lynn became her pal’s bodyguard in a way.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jamie Lynn Spears Has A Podcast In The Works That Nobody Asked For</a></span></p><p>In 2015, Jamie Lynn Spears was in Hammond, Louisiana with friends when they decided to pick up some food at a restaurant called the Pita Pit. Then, everything changed in an instant when one of Jamie Lynn’s friends was hit in the head with a bottle. When most people think about how they would handle things if their friend was attacked with a blunt weapon, they would like to think they would come to their pal’s defense. In reality, however, a lot of people would be too afraid to put themselves at risk like that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately for her friend, Jamie Lynn Spears sprung into action the second her pal was in danger. In a scene that was caught on surveillance camera, Jamie Lynn can be seen going to the other side of the Pita Pit’s counter in search of something to help her friend. From there, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamie Lynn picked up a “long serrated bread knife” and used it to ward off her friend’s attacker</a>. As the New York Daily News reported, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamie Lynn’s friend opted to not press charges</a> after the incident, so her attacker wasn’t arrested.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that Jamie Lynn Spears’ friend opted to not press charges against her attacker and everything calmed down once the star got involved, some people may not think that the situation was a big deal. However, hitting someone with a bottle is a very violent act that could do serious damage. Keeping that in mind and the fact that at the moment she had no way to know if the attacker had other weapons, Jamie Lynn really did put herself at risk by defending her friend.</p><h2 id=jamie-lynn-spears-rsquo-more-famous-knife-incident>Jamie Lynn Spears’ More Famous Knife Incident</h2><p>Several years after the 2015 incident at the Pita Pit, Jamie Lynn Spears wound up in the headlines once again because of a story related to a knife. While many people were impressed by Jamie Lynn defending her friend, the latter knife-related headline left many people very angry at her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In January of 2022, Jamie Lynn Spears’ memoir “Things I Should Have Said” was released. While some people would have been interested in learning about Jamie Lynn’s life even if her book never mentioned her big sister, the press only covered what the book said about Britney Spears. As a result, a segment of Jamie Lynn’s book that claimed that Britney once locked herself in a room with her little sister while brandishing a knife is what garnered most of the headlines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once details of Jamie Lynn Spears’ memoir began to be covered in the media, Britney Spears reacted to the claim her little sister made about her and a knife. To say that Britney was outraged by Jamie Lynn’s claim is a huge understatement. In response, Britney posted a statement on Twitter that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">implied that Jamie Lynn was “scum”</a> and took her little sister to task in a lot of other ways.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Jamie Lynn Spears Cries, Says Relationship With Sister Britney Is 'Complicated'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmqWZmnqtxc2nZKyolZa%2FtHnKp6CfnV2osKK6w5qjZquRq7KlecWroJ6mlKh6rbXFnmY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jamie-lynn-sigler-debuts-baby-son-beau-kyle-dykstra-see-the-adorable-photo-20131810.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jamie-Lynn Sigler Debuts Son Beau Kyle Dykstra: Picture</a>
