have apparently broken up</a>. As quickly as they were speculated to be a couple, <a href=#><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong></a> and <strong><a href=#>Bad Bunny</a></strong> have called it quits. The duo had been seen together less lately, leading many to wonder when and where things went sour. It appears, however, like many celebrity romances, careers came first for both Jenner and Bad Bunny. Both are successful, with <a href=#>Jenner making millions in endorsement deals alone</a>, and Bad Bunny has taken the <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> world by storm.</p><p>Once it was clear that the two were not together anymore, rumors began to swirl about their relationship in general. After all, neither Bad Bunny nor Jenner ever confirmed their relationship. As a result of "insiders" or "sources" who knew the inside scoop, the romance played out in the press.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h5 class=display-card-title></h5><p>While Jenner and Bad Bunny did spend time together, there was never any confirmation that they were exclusive or that they were anything more than good friends. Because of this, it may be possible that there was nothing there to break up and that people saw what they wanted in the paparazzi pictures that made headlines for months.​​​​​​​</p><h2 id=bad-bunny-and-kendall-jenner-39-s-break-up-did-not-surprise-anyone>Bad Bunny And Kendall Jenner's Break-Up Did Not Surprise Anyone</h2><h3 id=kendall-and-bad-bunny-reportedly-dated-from-february-to-december-2023>Kendall and Bad Bunny reportedly dated from February to December 2023</h3><p>When it was announced in December 2023 that Bad Bunny and <strong><a href=#>Kendall Jenner</a></strong> were no longer together, friends of the two and fans alike were not surprised. After all, while the two were seen together on occasion since it was first rumored they were dating in February 2023, they were not inseparable.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Many said Jenner and Bad Bunny did not have compatibility</a>. Instead, it appeared the two led very separate lives and got together when they could.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bad-bunny-and-kendall-jenner.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Of course, they want the best for their friend, but they really didn’t feel like Kendall was as compatible with Bad Bunny as she was in past relationships with other people," a source explained.</p><p>With that being said, however, it appears that those close to Jenner have not completely ruled out the two getting together again if they happen to be in the same place at the same time, given Jenner's history with those she has dated, given that "Kendall has had a few on-off relationships in the past."</p><p>But to be an on-again/ off-again couple would imply that two people were together, to begin with — something that Jenner and Bad Bunny never confirmed about their relationship with one another.</p><h2 id=kendall-jenner-and-bad-bunny-never-confirmed-they-were-a-couple>Kendall Jenner And Bad Bunny Never Confirmed They Were A Couple</h2><h3 id=kendall-and-bad-bunny-were-never-quot-official-quot>Kendall and Bad Bunny were never "official"</h3><p>Despite the fact that Bad Bunny and Jenner had been photographed from early 2023 and into the summer at dinners, vacations, and events together, neither one ever confirmed that they were a couple. Both instead chose not to answer anything about their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bad Bunny led the charge when it came to not discussing his relationship status with Jenner</a>. This added fuel to the romance fire at the time, with many thinking they were just being cagey with their answers.</p><p>"I know something is going to come out. I know [people are] going to say something," Bad Bunny explained. "People know everything about me, so what’s left for me to protect? My private life, my personal life."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/kendall-jenner-and-bad-bunny-spotted-on-date-night-after-he-reveals-he-doesn-t-want-marriage-or-kids-with-her.jpg><p>When asked specifically about his romance with Jenner, Bad Bunny reaffirmed his previous answer.</p><p>"That’s the only answer," Bad Bunny said. "In the end, the only thing I have is my privacy."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenner was also asked to comment on her relationship with Bad Bunny</a>. Her response was a non-response.</p><p>"No comment," Jenner said.</p><h5 class=display-card-title></h5><p>She went on to explain, "I try [to] find the balance of keeping things private and keeping things sacred, [and] also not letting the unfortunate frustration and stress of everyone trying to get in on it stop me from enjoying my side. Does that make sense? I’ll go out of my way to do things as privately as possible because I just think that that’s the healthier way of dealing with relationships anyway."</p><p>This led many to believe that the two just wanted privacy in their lives until they were ready to have a hard launch on their relationship. <a href=#>After all, Bad Bunny did not reveal he was in a relationship with Gabriela Berlingeri until they had been together for three years</a>. Yet later, <a href=#>Bad Bunny denied ever dating Gabriela, insisting they were only best friends</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But, others now believe that there was nothing serious between Bad Bunny and Jenner at all. Instead, the two used their fame together as nothing more than a publicity stunt.</p><h2 id=was-the-bad-bunny-kendall-jenner-a-publicity-stunt>Was The Bad Bunny-Kendall Jenner A Publicity Stunt?</h2><h3 id=some-suspect-the-two-were-only-39-dating-39-for-notoriety>Some suspect the two were only 'dating' for notoriety</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kendall-jenner-and-bad-bunny-can-t-hold-back-the-pda-at-drake-s-concert-as-she-sees-long-term-potential.jpg><p>Months ago when Jenner and Bad Bunny were reportedly dating, fans were already wondering if the two being together was nothing but a publicity stunt. After all, if it was, the two had quite a bit to gain.</p><p>For starters, Bad Bunny was already a crossover artist in February 2023. However, he had just come off of World's Hottest Tour and unbeknownst to fans, Bad Bunny announced in October 2023 that the Most Wanted Tour would begin in 2024. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">By "leaking" the relationship with Jenner, Bad Bunny's presence in the media would go up dramatically</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This would not only help to bring his music to a new audience but it would also help Bad Bunny to sell out his upcoming tour. Both of which were accomplished with his connection to Jenner.</p><h5 class=display-card-title></h5><p>In addition, with Jenner receiving flack from the Hispanic community over her tequila brand, having Bad Bunny endorse 818 could increase sales, according to fans. Bad Bunny did endorse Jenner's brand heavily on social media, perhaps introducing a new group of people to 818 that would not have tried it in the past.</p><p>As such, it would not be out of the realm of possibility, per fans, if Jenner and Bad Bunny did nothing more but use their time together to promote one another and their respective brands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoLKvsMClo2ailaO7pr6MmqWdZZKWsW6u1KelsmWVq7KzecKopZ%2BhoqJ6tbTEsmSwnaKaeqWt06KloGc%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./khloe-kardashian-teases-kylie-jenner-over-her-giant-puffer-coat-details.html>&#171;&nbsp;Khloe Kardashian Teases Kylie Jenner Over Her Giant Puffer Coat: Details</a>
