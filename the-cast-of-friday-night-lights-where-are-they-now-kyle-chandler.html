This high school football team was so much more than just a bunch of players and a coaching staff. They were a family, thanks to Coach Eric Taylor who put his blood, sweat and tears into these boys. Many lacked a father figure or any mentor figure at all for that matter, so Coach Taylor stepped into that role model. With the help of his lovely wife, Tami Taylor, they became the ultimate dream team. Each and every character on the show made you feel something and that is why NBC's Friday Night Lights reached television domination.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Crazy Salary Bump Jason Sudeikis Got For 'Ted Lasso'</a></span></p><p>The show ran from 2006 to 2011 and is still watched to this day.

Coach Taylor<a href=#> is like the original Ted Lasso </a>and there's a reason why both these shows are such a massive success. You can even argue that All American is sort of a remake of FNL.
