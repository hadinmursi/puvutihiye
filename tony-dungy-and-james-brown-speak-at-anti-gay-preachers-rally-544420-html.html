Presently they are campaigning for acknowledgment and in any event, advancing it as an acknowledged and ordinary way of life, and it’s not.”</p><p>“Assuming that you are a Christian assuming you guarantee to be a Christian, and you advance homos*xuality as an acknowledged way of life… that’s what on the off chance that you accept, you are standing firm totally against the expression of god.” He has straightforwardly drawn matches among homos*xuality and murder.
