daughter.</span></p><p><span>The news about Farrah’s pregnancy was so hard to bear as it even sparked an argument between the TV star and her mother who stopped her from aborting the child.&nbsp;The reality star finally had her baby the following year and also had her&nbsp;</span><span>16 and pregnant</span><span>&nbsp;episode aired in the United States the same year.</span></p><p><span>Despite her teenage pregnancy drama, Farrah has successfully gone on to become a movie industry superstar.&nbsp;She stands out as one of the wealthiest young mothers in the business and owes her rise to fame
