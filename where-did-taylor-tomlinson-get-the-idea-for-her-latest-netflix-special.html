platform. Comedians like Kapil Sharma, Ms. Pat and even David Spade made their debuts on the streamer with the specials I’m Not Done Yet, Y’all Wanna Hear Something Crazy?, and Nothing Personal, respectively.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>More experienced names like Ali Wong, Mike Epps and Ricky Gervais have also returned with new stand-up productions for Netflix.</p><p>California-born comic Taylor Tomlinson falls into this latter category. She got another opportunity to feature on Netflix with her special titled Look At You, which was released in early March. The special has garnered a lot of attention as well as positive reviews, with the Google ratings for the show saying that 88% of audience members had liked it.</p><p>Tomlinson herself – a protégé of sorts to more seasoned comedy star Whitney Cummings – has been singing the praises of the special. In an appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show in April, she said, “I promise it’s hilarious.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Little-Known Facts About Comedian Whitney Cummings</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-was-taylor-tomlinson-rsquo-s-life-like-growing-up><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>What Was Taylor Tomlinson’s Life Like Growing Up?</span></h2><p>Taylor Tomlinson was born in Orange County, California, in the autumn of 1993. She is the oldest of four siblings – all girls. She attended Temecula Valley High School in the state, and later California State University San Marcos, although she never graduated after deciding to drop out and pursue her comedy career instead.</p><p>Her family was very staunchly religious as she was growing up, something which constantly features in her comedy.</p><h2 id=taylor-tomlinson-lost-her-mother-to-cancer-at-the-age-of-8><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Taylor Tomlinson Lost Her Mother To Cancer At The Age Of 8</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another thing that often pops up in Taylor Tomlinson’s comedy routine is the most tragic event of her life. When she was eight, she lost her mother to cancer, after which her father soon remarried.</p><p>Tomlinson expresses some bit of comic relief about this tragedy in Look At You, when she asks the audience if they think she’d have been as successful if her mother never died: “She’s in heaven, I’m on Netflix — it all worked out,” she says.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ranking Netflix's Best Stand-Up Comedy Specials From Worst To Best</a></span></p><h2 id=is-taylor-tomlinson-single><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Is Taylor Tomlinson Single?</span></h2><p>As with any other successful celebrities, fans are bound to wonder of Taylor Tomlinson: is she single <a href=#>or in a relationship</a>? Being a comedian, it is not surprising that the 28-year-old has often segued in details of her love life into her stand-up routines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following the outbreak of COVID, she was quarantined for a few months with fellow comedian Sam Morril, with whom she was in a relationship at the time. Rumors have been rife that their fling is now a thing of the past, something that neither have commented on so far.</p><h2 id=how-did-taylor-tomlinson-get-into-comedy><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Did Taylor Tomlinson Get Into Comedy?</span></h2><p>Taylor Tomlinson’s comedy journey can be traced back to her days as a devout, church-going Christian. Her father Eric shares her interest in stand-up comedy, and he signed the both of them up for a class at their church when she was 16.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This became the launchpad for her career, as she began to perform in churches, schools and cafés to hone her skills. The dream died not too long afterwards for Eric Tomlinson, however, with his daughter once saying that he “went back to making money at an actual upstanding career.”</p><h2 id=taylor-tomlinson-rsquo-s-big-break-was-on-a-reality-show-on-nbc><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Taylor Tomlinson’s Big Break Was On A Reality Show On NBC</span></h2><p>After years of slugging it out in church and school venues as well as comedy clubs, Taylor Tomlinson got her big break in the industry when she contested the ninth season of Last Comic Standing on NBC in 2015.</p><p>Although she did not emerge victorious on the show, she arrived to national attention, and her career began to blossom. She also made a radical shift in the content of her comedy, moving away from the strictly “clean” brand of jokes that fit within that religious background.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Stand Up Comedians Are Rising Stars Thanks To TikTok</a></span></p><h2 id=how-many-comedy-specials-does-taylor-tomlinson-have-on-netflix><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>How Many Comedy Specials Does Taylor Tomlinson Have On Netflix?</span></h2><p>Before Look At You came out on Netflix in March, Taylor Tomlinson had one previous special on the streamer: Her debut special was titled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quarter-Life Crisis</a> and was released in March 2020.</p><p>According to Rotten Tomatoes, the comedian in the one-hour show spoke about “working on yourself, realistic relationship goals, and why your twenties are not actually the best years of your life.”</p><h2 id=where-did-taylor-tomlinson-draw-inspiration-for-look-at-you><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Where Did Taylor Tomlinson Draw Inspiration For Look At You?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A lot of the issues that Taylor Tomlinson addresses in Look At You are derived from her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">personal challenges with mental health</a>. She spoke about this when she appeared on The Kelly Clarkson Show, saying that she borrowed her therapist’s advice for some bits in the special.</p><p>“There’s a line in the special that I say… which is something my psychiatrist said to me and I totally stole it like it’s my own idea,” Tomlinson said.</p><h2 id=taylor-tomlinson-is-also-now-a-mental-health-advocate><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Taylor Tomlinson Is Also Now A Mental Health Advocate</span></h2><p>Recently, there has been <a href=#>uproar on Twitter</a> over the level of attention that celebrities’ mental health gets compared to that of everyone else.
