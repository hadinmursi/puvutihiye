Ford has reportedly undertaken a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"grueling exercise regime"</a> to get in shape for Indiana Jones 5, which includes cycling up to 40 miles a day. Ford also cut out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">meat and dairy</a>, telling Ellen DeGeneres in 2020: "I eat vegetables and fish, but I've cut out dairy.

It was all about helping him sustain the pace and avoid injury."</p><p>"We don't include running because that's not good for your knees and back as you get older," trainer Jamie Milne continued. "None of the workouts are about vanity or making him look good either. There's no need - he already does.
