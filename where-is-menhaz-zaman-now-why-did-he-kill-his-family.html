Despite the fact that he was at first accused of four counts of first-degree murder, he was condemned to serve life in jail for three first-degree murders (of Firoza, Moniruz, and Malesa) and one second-degree murder (of Momtaz) in November 2020.</p><p>“No right-considering part society would see any distant connection between’s the fast approaching exposure of the mystery of Mr. Zaman’s non-participation at school and the awful taking of the existences of the four individuals nearest to him,” said Justice Michelle Fuerst after conveying Zaman’s sentence from a Newmarket, Ontario, court. “Words, for example, merciless, awful, cold and insensitive don’t start to convey the monstrosity of his viciousness,” Justice Fuerst added.</p><p>In October 2020, before his sentence, Zaman apologized for his activities during a condemning hearing. “I might want to simply apologize to anybody I have affected adversely with my activities. Particularly to individuals who knew my family – companions and friends and family who I know might have never seen something like this from me occurring,” he said.</p><p>Notwithstanding the sentence to serve life in jail, Zaman got parole ineligibility of 25 years for the three first-degree murders and 15 years for the second-degree murder, making his complete parole ineligibility 40 years.</p><p>According to the last reports, Zaman is imprisoned at Central East Correctional Center AKA Lindsay Jail, situated at Kawartha Lakes County Road 36, Lindsay, Ontario.
