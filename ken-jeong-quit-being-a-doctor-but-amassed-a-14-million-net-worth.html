That’s probably because making people laugh is not as easy as it seems. This might also explain why not all comedies are successful. For instance, there are just way too many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">underrated comedies from the ’80s</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and the ’90s</a>.

Fortunately, actor and comedian, Ken Jeong, seems to know how to do just that. Over the years, Jeong has starred in several popular films and TV shows. He's racked up major cash in the process. In fact, he has reportedly amassed a net worth of $14 million.</p><p>Curious about how he made that happen?

During the day, I was a doctor. At night, you know, I was a comic,” Jeong told NPR. “And it was really just to let off some steam. It just became my golf, you know, in many ways. Most doctors have golf as a hobby.

He was looking for an Asian actor with medical experience,” Jeong told NPR. “That coincided with me leaving medicine. It was kind of time to - time to go.

So, for me it’s an embarrassment of riches at this point because– Yeah, in the first Hangover, I think I was only on set for maybe, like, four days.
