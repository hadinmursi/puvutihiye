Ever since Swift started her <a href=#>compelling relationship with Travis Kelce</a>, she has met his whole family and also become close to <strong>Kelce's teammate <a href=#>Patrick Mahomes</a>' wife Brittany Mahomes</strong>.</p><p>There's no question that Brittany's profile has been raised in the past year. For example, Brittany and Patrick Mahomes went to the Time 100 Gala in April 2024 and The Daily Mail reported on her crop top and impressive abs. However, as The Daily Mail reported, there was also talk of trouble between the two famous friends. In this article, we'll take a look at <strong>the truth about Brittany Mahomes and Taylor Swift's friendship </strong>and the accusation that <strong>Brittany wanted to be friends with Swift so she could make money</strong>.

Sources close to Swift have noticed some odd things, and if these claims are true, it definitely doesn't look good. If these claims are true, then Brittany wanted to become friends with Swift in order to become more famous so she could add to her net worth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/did-taylor-swift-save-brittany-mahomes-tarnished-image_.jpg><p>To start with, <strong>Brittany once tweeted negative things about Swift</strong>, asking when she would "find something different to write about besides boys and relationships." She also tweeted, "Taylor Swift winning everything." Some people believe that if Brittany really felt that way about Swift and her music, then she only wants to be friends with her because of Swift's fame. If this is true, then Brittany thinks that being photographed with Swift at Kansas City Chiefs games can help her make money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ttweb_did-taylor-swift-ever-write-a-song-about-tom-hiddleston-_bk_a1_v3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Taylor Swift Ever Write A Song About Tom Hiddleston?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift has written some iconic songs about her ex boyfriends, but is Tom Hiddleston one of them?</span><p>A source told Life & Style Magazine:</p><p>“Taylor wasn’t happy.

Since Taylor Swift and Kim Kardashian have had conflict for a long time, Swift's fans and sources close to her are confused that Brittany would make that business decision. It's possible to say that Brittany ignored the tension between Swift and Kim because she wanted to make money from the Skims endorsement. While it's unknown how much she was paid, it must have been a good amount.</p><p>A source said:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She has tried so hard to insert herself into Swift's circle...

Since <strong>Swift has a song called "Wildest Dreams" </strong>on her "1989" album, many thought she said that on purpose. While she might have been trying to compliment her friend, many people thought it was the wrong thing to say. It's unclear if Swift was upset about this or felt that it was a problematic comment. People think it's another sign that Brittany used Swift so she could become more successful.</p><p>Many wonder <a href=#>if Brittany Mahomes likes her fame</a> because people insult Brittany regularly. But it seems like the backlash about her friendship with Taylor Swift is sticking. No one really knows if Brittany is using Swift for money unless she confirms it.
