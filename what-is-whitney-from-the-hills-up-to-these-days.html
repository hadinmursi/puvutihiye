She is a working mom and has several sources of income that she works hard at. She also has over a million followers on Instagram and keeps up a great social media presence on the internet. She is still happily married to Tim Rosenman and has been trying to grow her family with not much luck. Here is what the former The Hills reality star is up to these days.</p><h2 id=whitney-port-is-married-to-tim-rosenman><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Whitney Port Is Married To Tim Rosenman</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Port married her husband, Tim Rosenman, in 2015, and they are still going strong today. Rosenman was a producer on her The Hills spin-off, The City, which was based on Port's life in New York City, and that is how they met. He has also worked as a producer for The X Factor. He also appeared on The Hills: New Beginnings with Port.</p><h2 id=whitney-port-has-a-son><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Whitney Port Has A Son</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Port and Rosenman have a son together named Sonny</a>, who was born in 2017. After he was born, Port posted a blog post and said that "I love him and I feel protective over him, but more than anything, I'm just like obsessed. I can't stop looking at him, or thinking about him when I am in another room. I can't wait to watch him change and grow and take on my traits and Timmy's." Sonny has made lots of appearances on Port's YouTube Channel over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Whitney Port Regret Starring On The City?</a></span></p><h2 id=whitney-port-has-had-several-miscarriages><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Whitney Port Has Had Several Miscarriages</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Port has, unfortunately, had three miscarriages</a> and a chemical pregnancy, with her latest loss happening in 2021. When she announced her latest pregnancy in November, she said that doctors had been monitoring her due to her history of miscarriages and that she was likely enduring "another unhealthy pregnancy." At a doctor's appointment, a heartbeat could not be found, and they learned that they had lost yet another baby. Port stated in a YouTube video that when she had the ultrasound, it looked like there was no embryo inside and that the yolk sac was thin, indicating that perhaps the pregnancy hadn't been healthy from the beginning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=whitney-port-has-a-podcast><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Whitney Port Has A Podcast</span></h2><p>Port has had her own podcast since May 2019, where she once even had Lauren Conrad on as a guest. She has trusted experts on various topics as guests as well as some of her favorite people in her life. In the description of her podcast, she claims that she hopes to be open and honest on her podcast where she talks about beauty, fashion, parenthood, relationships and more.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Whitney Port Met Her Hubby, Tim Rosenman</a></span></p><h2 id=whitney-port-did-a-hills-rewatch-on-youtube><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Whitney Port Did A Hills Rewatch On YouTube</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the pandemic, Port did a rewatch of The Hills on her YouTube channel alongside her husband, which was fun, since he produced her reality spin-off series, The City, and provided commentary from his side of things. Most celebrities are doing rewatch podcasts, but Port's rewatch was fun, as it was solely on YouTube, and they were able to play the episodes on the screen as they watched and commented on them.</p><h2 id=whitney-port-created-a-fashion-brand><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Whitney Port Created A Fashion Brand</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Port created the brand COZeCO</a>, which is a cozy line of super comfortable clothing.

"I've always been a fan of Rent the Runway," Port said in a quote posted on their website. "Their entire model of making fashion more sustainable is really important - it makes people feel good about what they're putting on their bodies." Pieces from her collection cost over $300 to buy, but only cost around $45 to rent.</p><h2 id=whitney-port-vlogs-on-youtube><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Whitney Port Vlogs On YouTube</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Port has been posting vlogs on her YouTube channel for many years now in order to keep her fans in the loop on what is going on in her life. Although she kept her personal life private on The Hills, she has been very open with fans on her social media. She has documented her pregnancy with her son, Sonny, as well as his birth and the journey of being a mom.
