His extremely <strong>edgy, sexed-up radio show broke records and revolutionized the industry</strong>, resulting in <a href=#>a boatload of money for the host</a>. Stern earned millions of listeners who both loved him and/or were deeply offended by him. In recent years, Stern has evolved into a first-class interviewer. His <a href=#>groundbreaking conversations with President Joe Biden</a> and <a href=#>conversation with Barbra Streisand</a> prove that he's the best in the business. But that's not to say that the satellite radio personality doesn't have legitimate competition in the podcast space. At least, this is the point <a href=#><strong>Jerry Seinfeld</strong></a> recently made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The acclaimed comedian and sitcom creator <strong>publicly apologized for comments he made about what happened to Howard Stern's career.</strong> Nobody forced Seinfeld to do this, but he clearly felt he needed to. This article will delve into what Jerry Seinfeld said about Howard Stern and why he apologized for it.

During the conversation with the Saturday Night Live greats, Seinfeld claimed that they had greater "comedy chops" than the self-proclaimed King Of All Media.<strong> Seinfeld was immediately apologetic after the episode aired</strong><strong>on Apple Podcasts</strong>. But before we can reveal and explain the apology, we have to understand what was said in the first place.</p><p>About 10 minutes into their hour-and-a-half-long interview, <strong>Seinfeld, Carvey, and Spade discussed the popularity of podcast culture</strong>. This caused Seinfeld to ask, "<strong>Howard Stern invented this, right?"</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While everyone seemingly agreed that podcast culture is due to the success of The Howard Stern Show and how it completely changed talk radio, <strong>Seinfeld claimed that they were funnier than Stern</strong>. In the interview, Seinfeld said the following:</p><p>“But we’re better than [Stern] now. Howard is interesting.

His show is off until Monday, May 13th, 2024, when he is likely to address it. Fans of Stern know that he will likely state that he was offended by the comments but accept the apology. Especially because <strong>Stern has personal relationships with Jerry Seinfeld, Dana Carvey, and David Spade</strong>... all of whom are frequent guests on The Stern Show.</p><h2 id=inside-jerry-seinfeld-39-s-relationship-with-howard-stern>Inside Jerry Seinfeld's Relationship With Howard Stern</h2><p>Somehow ironically,<strong> Jerry Seinfeld was the one who convinced Howard Stern to renew a 5 year contract with SiriusXM</strong> back in 2020.

Seinfeld has also been a frequent guest on his radio show for years, even after Stern has had impersonators (such as the late Gilbert Gottfried) mock him on air. Stern has also appeared on Seinfeld's Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee; a show that's reserved for the friends and those Seinfeld greatly respects.</p><p>While <strong>Howard Stern and Jerry Seinfeld consider each other friends</strong> and have been spotted at events with one another, there's no doubt that the comedian's comments will hurt the radio show host. But given their history together, and the fact their wives (Beth and Jessica, respectively) are friends, fans are certain Seinfeld and Stern will mend fences. But Howard Stern Show listeners will have to wait and see until Stern publicly responds to this scandal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqqirnq0scinnZ6klGK1sMPAq5tmq6Sav695wqikpp2eqcBuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ji-yeon-kim-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-631638-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ji Yeon Kim Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a>
