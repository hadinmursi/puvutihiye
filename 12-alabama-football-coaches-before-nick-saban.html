Beaumont and Wallace Wade’s dynasty to the legend of Bear Bryant and the triumphs of Gene Stallings, each coach navigated the tide of expectations, forging legacies of grit, glory, and sometimes, heartbreak.</p><p>Today we will discuss the twelve personalities who were in charge of the Alabama football team before Saban. The list will not exclude Mike Price who was hired in December 2002 and fired before the start of the season, and the only interim manager Joe Kines, who coached for one game in 2006.</p><h2 id=xen-scott><span class=ez-toc-section id=xen-scott></span> Xen Scott<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Xen C. Scott led the Crimson Tide from 1919 to 1922, amassing a 29-9-3 record. His 1920 squad notched a school-best 10-1 mark, the school’s first ten-win campaign.</p><p>He is credited with recruiting Joe Sewell to Alabama, who went on to become a star player for the Crimson Tide and later the Cleveland Indians.</p><p>He is also credited with developing the “run and shoot” offense, which would later be used by some of the most successful coaches in college football history.</p><h2 id=wallace-wade><span class=ez-toc-section id=wallace-wade></span> Wallace Wade<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wade isn’t just remembered for his 61-13-3 record at Alabama, three national titles (1925, 1926, 1930), and four Southern Conference championships.</p><p>Under him, Rose Bowl appearances weren’t dreams, they were expectations. He led the team to three of them and won two.</p><p>He implemented the forward pass, revolutionized the single wing, and brought a swagger to the Crimson Tide. He also recruited African American players for the first time in Alabama history, paving the way for future equality.</p><p>Wallace recruited Bear Bryant, coached Frank Thomas to a future national title, and built a program that would dominate for decades to come.</p><h2 id=frank-thomas><span class=ez-toc-section id=frank-thomas></span> Frank Thomas<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Coaching from 1931 to 1946 (with a wartime break in 1943), Frank Thomas’ tenure boasts impressive stats: 115 wins (3rd most in Alabama history), 24 losses, and 7 ties.</p><p>Under Thomas, the Crimson Tide saw three undefeated seasons (1934, 1936, 1945), two national championships (1934, 1941), and trips to six major bowls, including three Rose Bowls. He was 4-2 in bowl games.</p><p>He developed the “Run, T, and Pass” offense, a revolutionary scheme at the time, and mentored legendary players like Don Hutson and Bear Bryant, himself.</p><p>He built a winning culture, ignited a passion for the game, and paved the way for the Crimson Tide’s future glory. He retired in 1946, leaving a legacy that paved the way for the likes of Bryant and Saban.</p><h2 id=harold-drew><span class=ez-toc-section id=harold-drew></span> Harold Drew<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harold Drew, nicknamed “Red” for his fiery personality, led Alabama through eight seasons, leaving a legacy of grit and offensive firepower.</p><p>His tenure (1947-1954) saw a 55-28-7 record, with the 1953 SEC championship and three bowl appearances (record 1-2).</p><p>Drew’s “T-formation” offense, featuring the likes of Johnny “The All-American” Mack, unleashed a potent rushing attack. The 1952 season stands out, boasting a 10-2 season record and a 61-6 Orange Bowl victory earning him the SEC Coach of the Year honor.</p><h2 id=jennings-b-whitworth><span class=ez-toc-section id=jennings-b-whitworth></span> Jennings B. Whitworth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jennings B. Whitworth, nicknamed “Ears” for his large, attentive ones, served as Alabama’s 18th head coach from 1955-57. His tenure bridged the gap between Harold “Red” Drew’s promising start and the legendary arrival of Paul “Bear” Bryant.</p><p>His tenure yielded a meager 4-24-2 record at a 16.7% win rate, the lowest winning percentage in program history.</p><p>He modernized Alabama’s offensive schemes, introducing the T-formation and laying the groundwork for Bryant’s later success. He recruited future stars like Lee Roy Jordan and John David Crow, who would flourish under Bryant.</p><h2 id=bear-bryant><span class=ez-toc-section id=bear-bryant></span> Bear Bryant<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Paul “Bear” Bryant reigns supreme as the architect of Alabama’s football dynasty. His 25-year tenure (1958-1982) remains a program record, boasting a staggering 232 wins, 46 losses, and 9 ties.</p><p>Bryant’s teams dominated the SEC, claiming 13 conference titles, the most in school history. He led the Crimson Tide to six national championships (1961, 1964, 1965, 1973, 1978, 1979).</p><p>His legacy extends beyond trophies. Bryant instilled a culture of excellence that permeates Alabama football to this day. He recruited and coached legends like Joe Namath and Kenny Stabler, leaving an indelible mark on the sport.</p><h2 id=ray-perkins><span class=ez-toc-section id=ray-perkins></span> Ray Perkins<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following the legendary Paul “Bear” Bryant was no easy feat, but Ray Perkins stepped into the crimson tide in 1983.</p><p>Perkins, a former NFL head coach, inherited a team still reeling from Bryant’s passing. He compiled a 32-17-1 record, leading Alabama to three bowl games and a 10-3 record in 1986. Notable victories included a 1984 upset of Auburn and a 1985 win over USC.</p><p>He brought stability and recruited future stars like Bobby Humphrey and Cornelius Bennett. However, Perkins struggled to replicate Bryant’s championship success and lacked national glory.</p><h2 id=bill-curry><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-curry></span> Bill Curry<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bill Curry (1987-1990) navigated the turbulent seas following Bear Bryant’s legacy. Despite facing immense pressure, he compiled a 26-10 record, including a share of the 1989 SEC title.</p><p>His “Run Right Pass Left” offense and charismatic leadership revived Bama’s passing game, featuring All-American quarterback Jeff Rutledge. He recruited future NFL stars like Bobby Humphrey and John Copeland.</p><p>But defensive struggles and inconsistency kept Alabama just outside the&nbsp;national championship conversation.&nbsp;Despite his successes, he couldn’t escape the shadow of Bryant.</p><h2 id=gene-stallings><span class=ez-toc-section id=gene-stallings></span> Gene Stallings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gene Stallings led Alabama through a resurgence after the legendary Bear Bryant era. His seven-year tenure (1990-1996) saw a 70-16-1 record, including a dominant 36-13-1 SEC mark.</p><p>Stallings ended the streak against rival Auburn in his first season, igniting fan passion. He then built a dynasty, winning four SEC West titles, and the 1992 SEC championship.</p><p>The crowning jewel, though, was the 1992 National Championship. Led by the iconic “Run DMC” backfield, Alabama went undefeated and capped the season with a Sugar Bowl victory over Miami.</p><h2 id=mike-dubose><span class=ez-toc-section id=mike-dubose></span> Mike DuBose<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mike DuBose, a Crimson Tide legend himself, took the helm in 1997, tasked with bridging the gap between Gene Stallings and Nick Saban. His four-year tenure (24-23 record) was a mixed bag, marked by both triumph and turbulence.</p><p>DuBose’s 1999 SEC Championship remains a cherished highlight. He brought in future NFL stars like Freddie Milons and Shaun Alexander, leading the Tide to a 10-2 season and a thrilling victory over Florida in the title game. But inconsistency plagued other years, culminating in a 3-8 record in 2000.</p><p>Notable moments included a 42-17 dismantling of Houston Cougars in 1997 and a 1999 comeback victory against Arkansas.</p><h2 id=dennis-franchione><span class=ez-toc-section id=dennis-franchione></span> Dennis Franchione<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dennis Franchione arrived in Tuscaloosa in 2001 inheriting a program reeling from NCAA sanctions and a fan base hungry for success. His tenure was brief (2 seasons) but impactful, laying the foundation for future prosperity.</p><p>Franchione’s 17-8 record may not scream dominance, but it included a 9-2 mark in 2002. While championships eluded him, Franchione’s 2002 team upset Tennessee, a monumental victory that restored hope to the Crimson Tide faithful.</p><p>While he left for Texas A&M after two years, Franchione stabilized the program, paving the way for Nick Saban’s dynasty.</p><h2 id=mike-shula><span class=ez-toc-section id=mike-shula></span> Mike Shula<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Son of legendary Don Shula, Mike took the helm at just 38, the second youngest in Divison I-A during his appointment. Battling NCAA sanctions, he navigated the side to a 6-6 record in 2004 before guiding the Tide to a 10-2 record in 2005.</p><p>From 2003 to 2006, Shula managed the team for 49 games, winning 26 while losing 23. But due to sanctions and vacated wins, the record shows a 10-23 win-loss record for Alabama during that period.</p><p>Likewise, he guided the team into two bowl games and won the 2006 Cotton Bowl game against the Texas Tech Red Raiders.&nbsp;Shula recruited future stars like Brodie Croyle and Julio Jones.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaGliYq6trcGapJpllqS8ta7ApaNmm5%2BWsKmx0maZnp6fp7JuusicomarkZeur3s%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./allison-dunbar-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>&#171;&nbsp;Allison Dunbar Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a>
