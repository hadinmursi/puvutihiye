They think that the political commentator is starting to appear a bit thinner than he was a few months ago. Sean Hannity has not acknowledged the weight loss speculations but many think that he may have followed the same diet routine and exercise schedule as he did in 2012 when he shed 27 pounds.</span></span></p><p><span>Sean Hannity</span> currently <span><span>hosts</span></span><span>The Sean Hannity Show</span>, a nationally syndicated talk radio show, and he also presents a commentary program <span>Hannity</span> on Fox News. With both of them being conservative political talk shows, he has really made his name as a conservative <span><span>political commentator</span></span>. His political beliefs and his conspiracy theories precede him. And currently, the weight loss speculations about him precede him.</p><p>Here’s everything to know about Sean Hannity’s weight loss!</p><p>You might also be interested to read the <span><span>weight loss</span></span> stories of <span><span>Heidi Klum</span></span> and <span><span>Bert Kreischer</span></span>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sean-hannitys-weight-loss-2023-people-think-hes-gotten-a-bit-thin-recently></span>Sean Hannity’s Weight Loss 2023: People Think He’s Gotten a Bit Thin Recently!<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Sean Hannity</span> (<span>@seanhannity</span>) has recently sparked weight loss speculations with his appearance. He seems to have gotten a bit thinner than he was a few months ago is what people have been thinking.</p><p>Since Hannity is the host of a commentary program <span>Hannity</span> which airs on Fox five days a week, he is never very far from our television screens which means he is rarely not in the public eye. So, any change he undergoes never escapes the public eye. They are bound to make that observation sooner or later and looks like they have noticed a new difference in his appearance. The difference after weight loss.</p><p>The casual observers who only occasionally tune into his show might not really see that Sean Hannity has changed in any way recently as of 2023. They would probably think that he looks the same as he did some weeks ago and would wonder what all the fuss was about. But really, if you are a regular viewer of the show, you will see that he has definitely gotten a little bit slimmer than he was a few weeks ago. It’s not a very noticeable weight loss but he certainly has lost some weight.</p><p>Because it’s only a slight difference and in such a short amount of time, it’s hard to notice but if you were to compare him in photos taken a few weeks ago and in pictures taken currently, you can see it more clearly and you can tell that he has had a weight loss. If not anything, just look at his face. It was so puffy back then but right now, his face looks not as puffed up. It is definitely weight loss, routine weight fluctuations, isn’t it?</p><p>Well, Sean Hannity has himself not acknowledged the weight loss speculations but it has really not stopped people from speculating how he lost weight. Since he hasn’t spoken up on it, they are coming up with their own theories and the most common theory they have is that he did the same thing he did in 2014 when he shed 27 pounds to lose weight.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sean-hannity-underwent-a-drastic-weight-loss-of-27-pounds-in-2012></span>Sean Hannity Underwent a Drastic Weight Loss of 27 Pounds in 2012!<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Sean Hannity</span> did undergo a <span>drastic weight loss after shedding 27 pounds</span> but it was more than a decade ago, in 2012, not in 2023. That time, he had decided to embark on a journey to lose weight because he was not very healthy weight-wise. He wasn’t in the best shape – a bit overweight. And he was very conscious about that. If he was not, he became conscious of his looks when a friend took a picture of him while playing golf. After that, he began to diet to lose weight.</p><p><span><span>In the fall of 2012, while playing golf, a friend took a picture of me. It was hideous — I looked four months pregnant. I had man boobs. I just said, “What am I doing to myself, letting myself go this way?” Around Christmas, I started my diet — Atkins, the low-carb, no-sugar diet. Within a week I’d lost 6 or 7 pounds. In six weeks, I went from 207 to 180, which I am now.</span></span></p><p>Since then, Sean Hannity has pretty much maintained the weight loss to some extent even though he tends to put weight back on easily. He said that the weight goes right back on if he goes away for a weekend and eats anything he wants. But if that happens, he immediately goes right back to high-protein/low carb and he ends up losing weight every time. Similar things might have happened recently. He gained a few pounds a few weeks back, switched to a high protein and low carb diet, and then got slimmer.</p><p>Besides that, Sean Hannity might also have worked out as he did in 2012. Back then, he spent an hour (he called it one nonstop hour of competitive intensity) three or four days doing a mix of kickboxing, Japanese jujitsu, submission, grappling, Filipino martial arts, blade, and firearms training. That not only helped him in his weight loss but it also made him stronger.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKuVlrtutMCnpaKsqWLEprXGoatmpJ%2BowG6wyJ1koZ1dnLK1ecBmmaKsXam1qrqMq5ycnZ6pubp7</p></div><div id=links><a href=./seth-wells-wife-bio-wiki-age-family-salary-and-wilx-tv-10-nbc-2.html>&#171;&nbsp;Seth Wells Wife, Bio, Wiki, Age, Family, Salary and WILX-TV 10, NBC</a>
