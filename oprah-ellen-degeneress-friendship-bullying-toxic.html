A Buzzfeed report claimed Ellen had been racially insensitive and had also bullied and even harassed others behind the scenes, based on interviews with 36 former staffers. The claims were devastating for Ellen and her eponymous show, and it was not long before she officially announced the upcoming end of Ellen after 19 hugely successful seasons.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This 'Big Bang Theory Star' Was Unimpressed By His Interview On The 'Ellen Show'</a></span></p><p>Oprah seems to have been a support to her friend in the months following the revelations, but how exactly has the news changed their friendship?</p><h2 id=ellen-has-denied-quitting-her-show-because-of-the-bullying-allegations><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Ellen Has Denied Quitting Her Show Because Of The Bullying Allegations</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“If it was why I was quitting, I would have not come back this year,” Ellen has said, </a>when asked if it was behind her decision to end Ellen. “I really did think about not coming back because … it was devastating,” she said of the Buzzfeed report. “I am a kind person.

Every single person in your audience who has been touched by you, by your laughter, by your jokes, by your kindness, by your sharing, by your being, that’s your legacy.
