Of course, Tesfaye also co-stars in the series as Tedros, a club owner and cult leader who attempts to control superstar Jocelyn's career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Selena Gomez dated Abel Tesfaye in 2016 for 10 months before their breakup in 2017. According to The Daily Mail, the fact that the show not only featured parallels to her own life but also was created by her ex-boyfriend is really what "creeped" her out. And fans seem to agree as various posts on TikTok, Twitter, and Instagram seem to draw multiple connections between the two. This goes far beyond the fact that both the main character on The Idol and Gomez are pop stars, or that they both dated Tesfaye (Tedros in the show).</p><h2 id=did-abel-tesfaye-base-jocelyn-in-the-idol-on-selena-gomez><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Did Abel Tesfaye Base Jocelyn In The Idol On Selena Gomez?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/th-image-template-2-4.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Abel Tesfaye, AKA The Weeknd, has made no comment on whether or not he based Jocelyn on his ex-girlfriend, Selena Gomez.

Most notably in the lyrics of his song "Call Out my Name" which featured the line, "Guess I was just another pit stop / 'Til you made up your mind / You just wasted my time."</p><p>According to The Daily Mail, Tesfaye may have felt slighted after Gomez ended things with him only to strike up a rekindled romance with her on-and-off-again flame, Justin Bieber. So, while he has not confirmed this, it's not entirely out of the question.</p><p>Additionally, according to Daily Dot, at a Cannes Film Festival press congress, Tesfaye did admit that he drew inspiration from various pop stars he'd encountered in the music business. But co-creator Sam Levinson added that the show wasn't supposed to be an homage to any one particular artist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-selena-gomez-comment-on-her-connection-to-the-idol><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Did Selena Gomez Comment On Her Connection To The Idol?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/selena-gomez-as-mabel-mora-in-only-murders-in-the-building-on-hulu.jpg><p>At the time of this writing, Selena Gomez has not officially commented on her alleged connection to her ex-boyfriend's show, The Idol. However, a source reportedly close to her told The Daily Mail that she and her team are taken aback by the whole thing.</p><p>"The similarities between Selena's life and Jocelyn's life are just uncanny," The source told The Daily Mail. "Being [that] she actually dated The Weeknd, it is even more creepy for her. Her real-life pain was used for entertainment value and that really irks her out. Everyone in her team who has known her for a very long time is dumbfounded by this, but at the end of the day Selena is going to do what she always does â rise above and move on."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez-and-jocelyn-are-both-child-actors-turned-pop-stars><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Selena Gomez And Jocelyn Are Both Child Actors Turned Pop Stars</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/selena-gomez-felt-ashamed-looking-back-at-how-she-handled-her-wizards-of-waverly-place-co-stars.jpg><p>In The Idol it's revealed that Lily-Rose Depp's Jocelyn began her career as a child star on a hit kid's TV series.

It was also incredibly tumultuous. One can't say the same for Gomez's relationship with her mother, Mandy Teefy. However, according to Us Weekly, the pair have gone through ups and downs in their relationship.

However, their relationship was further tested due to her dating Justin Bieber. Like many of Gomez's fans, Teefy had "trust issues" with Bieber as his rocky relationship with her daughter progressed.
