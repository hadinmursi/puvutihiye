Despite her success, there have been many artists who’ve rejected collaborating with Swift.

His label suggested bringing the ‘Shake It Off’ singer to the studio to record his song ‘Secret Key,’ which Turner wrote for primary school teacher Christa McAuliffe, who died in 1986 in the Space Shuffle Challenger disaster. "I wanted the end [of the song] to be sung by an American woman [pretending] to be Christa,” the singer revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, he didn’t like the producer’s suggestions for this song. "The record label [Polydor] were suggesting some of the more famous people that [producer Butch Walker] has worked with, like, f****** Taylor Swift,” he explained. “No contact was ever made but they were like, 'Let's ask Taylor'. I was like, 'That's a f****** rubbish idea'."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Taylor Swift Showcased Her Business Smarts After She Avoided A Major Deal Worth Millions With FTX</a></span></p><p>Ultimately, Turner decided to collaborate with Esma Patterson.</p><p>"She just wasn't right for the record. And @EsmePatterson is awesome. The end," he tweeted at the time. Later on, the musician explained that he had no bad blood towards Swift but he feared that she would have overshadowed him if they had worked together. "Nothing against Swift, but she'd totally overshadow what I'm doing," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-1975-rsquo-s-lead-vocalist-matt-healy-accused-taylor-swift-of-hiding-their-collab-for-midnights>The 1975’s Lead Vocalist, Matt Healy, Accused Taylor Swift of Hiding Their Collab for Midnights</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/matt-healy.jpg><p>The 1975’s vocalist Matt Healy and Taylor Swift have given fans plenty to talk about, starting from their rumored relationship earlier this year. Shortly after they were first spotted together, fans speculated that <a href=# rel=nofollow>Healy and Swift were just collaborating on some songs</a>. However, Healy quickly shot those rumors down. “I would love that!

Shortly after its release, the album went on to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

Of course, Eric Clapton.” He then added, “I’d like to enter into the music of the youngsters, you know? Whether it’s rap like Jay-Z.
