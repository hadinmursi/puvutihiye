The outlet <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reports that Mrs. Cosby refuses to fire the staffers and chefs that have worked for her for decades</a>, despite the fact that these employees have not been paid for months, and the celebrity couple do not have the means to pay them in the immediate future.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bill-cosby-charges.jpg><p>A source for Radar Online went on to say that Bill Cosby is "frustrated" over the matter, and wants to let the staffers go, as he's unable to "live that lifestyle," but Camille won't budge on the matter. The source went as far as to label the topic a "major issue" in their marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This isn't the first time that rumors of marital problems have surfaced for the Cosby's. During Bill's prison stint, many claimed that Camille would leave the famous comedian, but the family spokesperson, Andrew Wyatt, issued a statement to People Magazine that laid the matter to rest:</p><p>"The accusations they have made in their tabloid are absolutely false. Mrs. and Mr. Cosby are not getting divorced and she’s with him in the Philadelphia home as we speak. No issues in the marriage, no issues with the children. These children are grown women in their 40s and 50s. These are not kids. These are not little kids running away from their father."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Wendy-Williams-Talking-About-Bill-Cosby.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Bill Cosby Tried To Get Wendy Williams Fired From Her Radio Show</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Wendy Williams Was Already "Dishing The Dirt" On Bill Cosby In 1990.</span><p>Steadfast as they might be in their commitment to their marriage, Bill and Camille Cosby have been hit with various financial setbacks since the former was released from prison.</p><h2 id=bill-cosby-and-his-wife-have-been-forced-to-pay-millions-in-property-taxes-to-the-irs-since-2019>Bill Cosby And His Wife Have Been Forced To Pay Millions In Property Taxes To The IRS Since 2019</h2><p>Bill Cosby was, for a time, <a href=#>one of the wealthiest comedians in Hollywood</a>.<strong> His estimated net worth was $400 million</strong>, according to Celebrity Net Worth, which was due to comedy tours and movie roles, as well as residuals from "The Cosby Show" and smart real estate deals.

The Blast obtained documents explaining that the comedian owed a combined $650,000 for failure to pay property taxes during his time in prison. He owed $88,566.88 for 2019 and $559,573.77 for the year 2020.
