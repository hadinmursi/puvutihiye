The legendary circus and tiger act lasted for over 30 years, and many events happened throughout that time. Some of which have become urban legends. They've even been depicted on shows such as the Simpsons.For decades, many have speculated about the true nature of Siegfried and Roy's relationship. Rumors of a love affair between the two men have circled for years. Given their level of stardom, it's strange that so little about what went on between them has been made public.
