But in recent years, he’s made it clear that he’s more than a YouTube sensation, albeit an absolutely controversial one. Still, Paul has made a name for himself in boxing, having <a href=#>gone up against Floyd Mayweather</a> himself (the fight had no declared winner, but <a href=#>Paul walked reportedly walked away with $20 million</a> nonetheless).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Floyd Mayweather Fans Say He's 'Finished' As He Fails To Knock Out Logan Paul</a></span></p><p>Ever since he became a star, there has also been some fascination regarding Paul’s dating life. At the same time, some of the women he’s been linked to have also opened up about their relationship with the YouTube star.</p><h2 id=teala-dunn-and-alissa-violet>Teala Dunn And Alissa Violet</h2><p>Dunn is social media star who was linked to Paul several years ago. Although their actual relationship was never confirmed, Dunn and Paul appeared together in several flirty videos. In the past, Dunn had also referred to Paul as her “YouTube crush.” Later on, Dunn also revealed that she and Paul kissed and “hooked up.” After doing videos together, Dunn and Paul seemingly went separate ways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while it’s unclear if the two remained friends over the years, it is worth nothing that Dunn called him out after Paul released a video shot in the Aokigahara Forest, which showed a blurred footage of a man who committed suicide. “Honestly, after seeing that he uploaded that video, I was shocked,” she said in a vlog. “I was disgusted. I was disappointed. I was really shocked.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alissa Violet and Paul were certainly an item at one point, although the two never officially became a couple. <a href=#>Their hookup was also quite controversial </a>since Violet was supposedly with Paul’s brother, Jake, around the time they got together. “We went to a club, with a bunch of our friends, and then me and Logan hooked up. I’m still disgusted by it, because it’s not who I am,” Violet confessed while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">speaking on Shane Dawson’s docuseries</a>. She also revealed that she messaged Paul about their hookup later on, asking him not to say anything as it was “a bad decision on both of our parts.” In response though, Paul allegedly said, “I’m a savage, I’m a maverick.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Twitter Dunks On Logan Paul After Claiming He Can Beat Mike Tyson</a></span></p><p>Since then, Violet said that she felt used. “I feel like I was a pawn in their game,” she explained. “They’re always trying to one-up each other. I was just a goal.” Meanwhile, Paul has denied Violet’s claims. During <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of True Geordie’s YouTube podcasts</a>, he claimed that Paul addressed the issue, denying that he ever said such a thing. The YouTube star even reportedly remarked, “In what real-world situation would anyone ever say that?”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chloe-bennet>Chloe Bennet</h2><p>Paul and Bennet started seeing each other after the two met on the set of Valley Girl. And when fans asked Bennet why she was dating the YouTube star, the actress remarked that Paul was “kind, creative, funny, vibrantly curious about life, weird as f*** in all the best ways, a big dork, and he’s one of my best friends.” Bennet also added, “He’s changed my life for the better and I’ve done the same for him.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The on-and-off couple split just after three months. And while speaking with The Hollywood Reporter, Paul recalled having a fight with Bennet right before a planned trip to Tokyo (Paul ended up going but Bennet didn’t join him). They reportedly argued because Paul insisted that they stay in different hotels. During their fight, Paul also recalled having an ominous conversation with the actress. “She’s like, ‘Yo, this behavior is going to bite you in the ass. I don’t know how, I don’t know when, but you’re going to crash and burn.’” Soon after, Paul released the controversial Aokigahara Forest video.</p><h2 id=josie-canseco>Josie Canseco</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As far as fans know, Canseco and Paul became an item in 2020. Unexpectedly, however, they parted ways for good after briefly reconciling their relationship in 2020. While speaking with Charlotte D’Alessio on her Between Good and Evil podcast, Canseco did acknowledge that she and Paul “went through some s***” together. However, they’ve remained friends even after they split. The model explained, “We just didn’t necessarily see a future with what we had there at the time, granted we’re fine now.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What's Going On With Logan Paul & Lil Baby?</a></span></p><p>In fact, Canseco even remained by Paul’s side around the time that he was preparing to fight Mayweather. “He has training camp, I’m just trying to be supportive and be what he needs in a partner and I think vice versa,” she explained. That said, it is also worth noting that Canseco’s father, retired baseball star Jose Canseco, has been openly feuding with her ex, which, she wishes, would stop. “He crossed a line of being selfish and embarrassing me calling out someone that I’m still very close with,” the model explained. “He came at Logan’s dad and tweeted pictures and saying s***. I don’t f*** with that fake internet s***.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since splitting from Canseco, Logan has been spotted with TikTok star Addison Rae, leading to rumors that the two are dating. However, Rae has denied that she is seeing the social media star.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Jonas Brothers Poke Fun At Logan Paul, Tease A UFC Match Against The Hemsworths</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijqJ%2BRo3qxrdSlZKChoqGzs7XEp5tmnJGptq%2BzjKGgrKyfp8Zw</p></div><div id=links><a href=./travis-kelce-likes-taylor-swifts-music.html>&#171;&nbsp;Travis Kelce Continues To Come Clean About If He Actually Likes Taylor Swift's Music</a>
