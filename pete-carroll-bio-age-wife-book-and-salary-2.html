He is 67 years old as of 2018. He is an actor, known for Cubed (2009), Carroll’s Trip to Seattle Delayed (2010) and NFL Monday Night Football (1970).</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=pete-carroll-family></span>Pete Carroll Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He was born in San Francisco, California, to Rita (née Ban) and James Edward “Jim” Carroll. Two of his paternal great-grandparents were Irish immigrants, and his Croatian maternal grandparents emigrated from around the region of Šibenik.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-911 data-method=placement-service></span></p><p>He attended Redwood High School in Larkspur, California. After being an athlete in childhood, his lack of physical growth as a teenager caused him frustration in high school sports; weighing just 110 pounds (50 kg) as an incoming freshman, he was required to bring a special doctor’s clearance in order to try out for football.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span></p><p>He was a multi-sport star in football (playing quarterback, wide receiver, and defensive back), basketball, and baseball, earning the school’s Athlete of the Year honors as a senior in 1969. He was inducted into the charter class of the Redwood High School Athletic Hall of Fame in April 2009. He has stated that one of his favorite players growing up was LSU defensive back Tommy Casanova and that LSU was a place that he always wanted to coach.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-912 data-method=placement-service></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=pete-carroll-wife></span>Pete Carroll Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He is married to Glena Goranson in 21st May 1976, after they divorced with Wendy Pearl, whom they joined in 1973 and separated in 1975.</p><p>He Glena Goranson when he was a student at the University of the Pacific. Both Pete and Glena were involved in sports with the Seatle’s head coach playing football while Glena played indoor volleyball. Although his first and rather short marriage did not produce any child, Carroll now has three children with his wife. Their oldest son, Brennan, also has his eyes on becoming a football coach. He worked with his father as a graduate assistant while he was at USC and then as wide receivers coach for the University of Miami where he first worked as tight end coach and recruiting coordinator.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=pete-carroll-salary></span>Pete Carroll Salary<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He reportedly received a 2016 pay raise, bumping him up to over $8 million a year. Until his’s contract extension, Sean Payton pulled in the highest NFL coaching salary, at $8 million. Bill Belichick, coach of the New England Patriots, boasts a salary of $7.5 million.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-913 data-method=placement-service></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=pete-carroll-book></span>Pete Carroll Book<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Win Forever: Live, Work, and Play Like a Champion</strong></p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span></p><p>He is one of the most successful coaches in football today. As the head coach at USC, he brought the Trojans back to national prominence, amassing a 97-19 record over nine seasons. In this book, he shares the championship-winning philosophy that led USC to seven straight Pac-10 titles and is now shaping his program with the Seattle Seahawks of the NFL.</p><p>Carroll developed his unique coaching style by trial and error over his career. He reveals how his recruiting strategies, training routines, and game-day rituals preserve a team’s culture year after year, during championship seasons and disappointing seasons alike.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span></p><p>Win Forever is about more than winning football games; it’s about maximizing your potential in every aspect of your life. Carroll has taught business leaders facing tough challenges. He has helped troubled kids on the streets of Los Angeles through his foundation, A Better LA. His words are true in any situation: “If you want to win forever, always compete.”</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-914 data-method=placement-service></span><br><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=pete-carroll-college></span>Pete Carroll College<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After high school, he attended junior college at the nearby College of Marin, where he played football for two years “lettering in his second year” before transferring to the University of the Pacific, where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. At Pacific, he played free safety for two years for the Tigers, earning All-Pacific Coast Athletic Conference honors both years “1971–72” and earning his Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in 1973.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span></p><p>After graduation, he tried out for the Honolulu Hawaiians of the World Football League at their training camp in Riverside but did not make the team due to shoulder problems combined with his small size. To make ends meet, he found a job selling roofing materials in the Bay Area, but he found he was not good at it and soon moved on; it would be his only non-football-related job.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=pete-carroll-usc></span>Pete Carroll Usc<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>USC Trojans “2000–2009”</strong></p><p><strong>Carroll giving an interview after a fall practice in 2008</strong></p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span></p><p>He was named the Trojans’ head coach on December 15. 2000, signing a five-year contract after USC had gone through a tumultuous 18-day search to replace fired coach Paul Hackett. He was not the Trojans’ first choice and was considered a long shot as the USC Athletic Department under Director Mike Garrett initially planned to hire a high-profile coach with the recent college experience.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-915 data-method=placement-service></span></p><p>Meanwhile, Carroll, who had not coached in over a year and not coached in the college ranks since 1983, drew unfavorable comparisons to the outgoing Hackett.</p><p>USC first pursued then-Oregon State coach Dennis Erickson, who instead signed a contract extension with the Beavers; then Oregon coach Mike Bellotti, who similarly signed an extension. The search then moved to the San Diego Chargers coach Mike Riley, who had been an assistant coach at USC before later becoming the head coach of Oregon State. Stuck in contractual obligations to the Chargers (who were still in the midst of an NFL season) and hesitant about moving his family, Riley was unable to give a firm answer, opening an opportunity for Carroll, the school’s fourth choice.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span></p><p>He actively pursued the position, as his daughter, Jaime, was then a player on the school’s successful volleyball team. After the first three primary candidates turned down the position, USC hired Carroll. Under Garrett, USC had tried to recruit Carroll to be their head coach in 1997, while he was coaching the Patriots, but he was unable to take the position.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-916 data-method=placement-service></span></p><p>The second time the opening came up, Daryl Gross, then senior associate athletic director for USC, recommended Carroll to Garrett based on his experience as a former scout for the New York Jets while Carroll coached there. He cited Carroll’s intelligence, energy, and reputation as a defensive specialist as reasons for his hire.</p><p>The choice of Carroll for USC’s head coaching position was openly criticized by the media and many USC fans, primarily because of USC’s stagnation under the outgoing Hackett and Carroll’s record as a head coach in the NFL and being nearly two decades removed from the college level. He took particular criticism for the hire, with the press tying his future with his’s after he had to fire two head coaches in four years for USC’s premiere athletic coaching position.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_15"></span></p><p>Former NFL players “including USC alumni” such as Ronnie Lott, Gary Plummer, Tim McDonald, and Willie McGinest offered their support for Carroll, who they noted had a player-friendly, easygoing style that might suit the college game and particularly recruiting. The USC Athletic Department received 2,500 e-mails, faxes and phone calls from alumni—mostly critical—and a number of donors asking for his’s removal before they would donate again.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span></p><p>Within a year of his hiring, many prominent critics reversed course. In 2008, ESPN.com named Carroll’s hiring number 1 in a list of the Pac-10’s top ten moments of the BCS era.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-917 data-method=placement-service></span></p><p><strong>Tenure</strong><br>The criticism of Carroll became louder when Carroll’s first USC team opened the 2001 season going 2–5, with some sportswriters writing off the once-dominant Trojans, who were the only Pac-10 football team to never finish in the national top 10 during the previous decade, as a dying program. However, after the slow start, Carroll’s teams proceeded to go 67–7 over the next 74 games, winning two national championships and playing for another.</p><p>He was considered one of the most effective recruiters in college football, having brought in multiple top-ranked recruiting classes; he was also known for getting commitments from nationally prominent players early in high school. His son, Brennan Carroll, was USC’s recruiting coordinator as well as the tight ends coach during the elder Carroll’s tenure as head coach. He had consistently been on the forefront of recruiting due to his ability to connect with potential players on their level, including becoming the first college coach with a Facebook page, as well as an early adopter of Twitter.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKiVqbJur8CrqaiknGKvqruMmp6eZaees6Z5waimpGWRo7Fuv8ClmKuxXWd8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./phaedra-parks-bio-wiki-age-height-husband-kids-rhoa-net-worth-2.html>&#171;&nbsp;Phaedra Parks Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Husband, Kids, RHOA, Net Worth</a>
