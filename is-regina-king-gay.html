The actor, who was formerly married, hasn’t been associated with anyone in the media since 2013.</p><p>Although she occasionally dates, Regina <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said to the New York Post</a> in 2019 that she is just too busy to be in a committed relationship.</p><p>“People ask you if you’re dating anyone,” she remarked. “I mean, I’m dating, but where I am right now is quite comfortable.
