In a lot of cases, the reason for that is viewers enjoyed those shows when they were on the air but they never got overly emotionally attached. On the other hand, a lot of <a href=#>people loved Shameless so much that they weren’t ready for the show to end</a>. In fact, even though <a href=#>Shameless featured some storylines that angered fans</a>, viewers remained passionate about the series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is Steve Howey's Life After 'Shameless'</a></span></p><p>In addition to the fact that Shameless viewers cared deeply about the show, a lot of fans also feel very attached to the show’s stars. For example, many Shameless fans are really invested in what Steve Howey has been up to since the show ended. In fact, those same fans are even interested to know how much money Howey’s ex-wife has following the couple’s divorce.</p><h2 id=how-did-steve-howey-and-sarah-shahi-rsquo-s-meet>How Did Steve Howey And Sarah Shahi’s Meet?</h2><p>Before Steve Howey joined the cast of Shameless, he starred in the sitcom Reba from 2001 until 2007. While landing a role in a long-lasting sitcom like that is the kind of thing that any actor would dream of, Howey’s Reba tenure was meaningful for the actor for another reason. Before Sarah Shahi became a famous actor, she was a young performer looking for any work in the entertainment industry. During that era in her career, Shahi landed a small role in the show Reba which allowed her and Howey to meet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Co-Stars Who Fell In Love On Set... But Didn't Last</a></span></p><p>After Steve Howey and Sarah Shahi met, they went on to get engaged in 2007. Two years after Howey popped the question, the couple walked down the aisle in 2009. The same year they were wed, Shahi gave birth to her first child with Howey and then in 2015 they welcomed their twins into the world. Remarkably enough, it is known that Shahi opted to welcome the three children she shares with Howey into the world via at-home water births.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-led-to-steve-howey-and-sarah-shahi-rsquo-s-divorce>What Led To Steve Howey And Sarah Shahi’s Divorce?</h2><p>Of course, it should go without saying that the only people who truly know what led to Sarah Shahi and Steve Howey’s divorce are the people who are directly involved. With that said, a report about the couple's marriage and something Howey said about their relationship in the past are quite revealing.</p><p>In 2016 when Steve Howey and Sarah Shahi were still married, they were sued by their nanny Sarah Alaseri. According to the lawsuit, Howey and Shahi mistreated the nanny in many ways. However, the aspect of the lawsuit that is the most revealing about why the couple divorced if true is that Alaseri claims Shahi wanted out of her marriage at that time. According to Alaseri, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shahi was having an affair with an “A-list” actor</a> so she wanted the nanny to “run off” with Howey so she’d be free to pursue the new relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Where Is Arnold Schwarzenegger's Baby Mama, Mildred Baena Now?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2016, Steve Howey spoke to a reporter for talknerdywithus.com. During their conversation, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howey revealed that he and Shahi were going through a rough patch</a> which gave him insight into what his Shameless character was going through at the time.</p><p>“My wife and I were like any other couple. All of our time was for each other. We would go on vacation, we’d have ice cream, we’d go to a movie, we’d do whatever we wanted to do. And then when we had the kids, it was really tough, all of that went away. And also we’re both working actors, so we were very tired, and when we’d come back, if there was any energy left it was for the kids, and not for each other. So we experienced that, I mean it almost broke us up. We didn’t really understand why, we just weren’t liking each other and we realized that things weren’t the same and it was really messed up. Because it was hard and we weren’t used to it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-are-steve-howey-and-sarah-shahi-rsquo-s-net-worths-post-divorce>What Are Steve Howey And Sarah Shahi’s Net Worths Post Divorce?</h2><p>Once most couples get married, they co-mingle most aspects of their lives including their finances. With that in mind, it makes sense that the divorce process often can be quite messy. On top of that, divorces usually cost a lot of money due to lawyer fees. For all of those reasons, it seems all but certain that Steve Howey and Sarah Shahi’s finances were both adversely affected by their divorce.</p><p>Even though their divorce would have been a drag on their bank accounts, Steve Howey and Sarah Shahi both still have a good amount of money due to their years as successful TV stars. According to celebritynetworth.com Howey is worth $2 million as of the time of this writing. As it turns out, Howey’s ex-wife has more than he does as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shahi is worth $3 million</a> according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How Much Is ‘Shameless’ Actor, Steve Howey Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIyiqmarpJrDpnnHqK6esaNixKqyxKxkp52kYsSwvtOhZJqepJq%2FbsDHnqCrZZSew7C%2Bwp5m</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-rich-is-cher-hubsher-father-dr-mason-hubsher-net-worth-after-retirement-2.html>&#171;&nbsp;How Rich Is Cher Hubsher Father Dr Mason Hubsher?
