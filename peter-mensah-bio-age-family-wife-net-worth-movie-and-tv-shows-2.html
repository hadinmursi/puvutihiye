Part of the reason he has such a lean muscular body is that he has been doing martial arts since he was a kid and naturally by doing martial arts he developed a lean flexible physique and a set of ripped abs.</p><p>Even though Peter was already lean and in great shape for Spartacus, he too did some extra training with the Spartacus crew, their goal was for the main actors, the Gladiators to have well-toned athletic muscle, functional muscle so they could move fast and look impressive during the various action scenes.</p><p>These guys really trained like gladiators, they used a combination of body-weight exercises and free weight focusing on the basic compound exercises. They even sent all the actors to a gladiator boot camp 3 (which included cardio as well as core training) weeks before filming started to get the actors into an even better condition.</p><p>To look that ripped they also had intense cardio training which involved functional cardio training like sessions on the rowing machine, medicine ball throws, mountain climbers and shuttle runs.</p><p>This must have been one of the toughest jobs because it included intense workouts, plus acting and including the action scenes. Obviously, Peter and the guys of Spartacus must have had to eat a lot of food with energy, such as energy shakes but their diet had to be low calorie at the same time to allow for fat loss, so they stayed away from sugars and alcoholic beverages such as beer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=peter-mensah-twitter></span>Peter Mensah Twitter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tweets by PMensahOnline</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKiVqbKzecyepayZmGKvqruMmp6eZZaWuqq42Gauop6VYrumwIywpqusmGK6sMLInmSappRiwbd50qGmsKtdZ3w%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./pitch-perfects-anna-camp-skylar-astin-are-married-w438983.html>&#171;&nbsp;Pitch Perfects Anna Camp, Skylar Astin Are Married</a>
